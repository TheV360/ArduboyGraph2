# Graph 2 (for the Arduboy)

A graphing calculator for your Arduboy!

# Features

Here's what's currently here:
* Simple keypad for entering numbers
* An RPN calculator
* Graph output
* Shunting-yard algorithm for converting user-readable functions.

Here's what I hope to accomplish in the near future:
* Better error reporting
* Coherent UI
* Table view
* Formula keyboard
* Direct mode (enter formulas, get response)

# Screenshots

I'm still working on the UI! If you want to see how far I've come, check out [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/V360dev/status/1191078748256456706)!
